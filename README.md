## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was just a recap of my CSS knowledge. I used mostly classic box and flex layout.

### Continued development

Research more on hover overlays.

### Useful resources

- [Clamp calculator](https://www.marcbacon.com/tools/clamp-calculator/) - This was useful for generating `clamp()` value for fluidly responsive card padding, instead of using media queries and "snappy" padding sizes.

- **Pixel Perfect Pro** add-on available for both Chrome and Firefox browsers. This was useful for making quicker comparisons between the design and my solution..
